- Name: ARP Cosmological Redshift Mapping
- Source: canonical-core-test
- Units: OK
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: A derived mapping for cosmological redshift that incorporates a phase-lifted saturation radius modifier, tested against standard \Lambda CDM expectations.
- Equation: z_{arp} = z_{standard} \left( 1 + \mathcal{F}_{phase}(r_s) \right)
- Assumptions: Mapping applies in the weak-field limit of the adaptive geometry; Saturation radius r_s is non-zero
- Evidence: Simulated curve memory variance in adaptive-pi geometry
- Animation: planned
- Image: planned
