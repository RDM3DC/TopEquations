### Shield Mechanic Law (ARP)
- Name: Shield Mechanic Law (ARP)
- Units: OK
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: Proposes a shielding effect in ARP systems, modeled as a partial cancellation of external field perturbations by induced adaptive current. Expressed as:
- Equation: E_eff = E_ext - λ·J_adapt, where J_adapt = σ·E_ext and λ is a shielding coefficient (0 < λ < 1).
- Assumptions: Linear field regime, uniform material, static boundary. λ is determined by ARP boundary condition fit; σ is local adaptive conductance.
