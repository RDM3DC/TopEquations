### EGATL Phase-Coupled Conductance Update
- Submission ID: sub-2026-02-24-egatl-phase-coupled-conductance-update
- Name: EGATL Phase-Coupled Conductance Update
- Source: EGATL original claim (ARP framework)
- Units: TBD
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: Minimal edge update with phase-coupled suppression. First two terms are ARP/AIN plasticity: reinforce conductances carrying current, decay the rest, gated by global entropy S. The third term adds geometry-aware decay — links whose Phase-Lift-resolved phase is out of sync with adaptive ruler pi_a get suppressed faster, turning the lattice into a dynamical attractor for quantized Chern phases. Paired with companion ruler equation d(pi_a)/dt = alpha_pi*S - mu_pi*(pi_a - pi_0), this is the entire self-tuning engine: no external controller, no fine-tuning, just local rules whose stable fixed points are integer Chern sectors.
- Equation: \frac{dG_{ij}}{dt} = \alpha_G(S)\, |I_{ij}| - \mu_G(S)\, G_{ij} - \lambda\, G_{ij}\, \sin^2\!\left(\frac{\theta_{R,ij}}{2\pi_a}\right)
- Assumptions: ARP/AIN plasticity framework; Phase-Lift resolution for theta_{R,ij} to avoid spurious branch flips; Global entropy S gates adaptation; Companion ruler equation d(pi_a)/dt couples to this update; Stable fixed points correspond to integer Chern sectors
- Evidence: Companion ruler equation: d(pi_a)/dt = alpha_pi*S - mu_pi*(pi_a - pi_0); Phase-Lift branch resolution eliminates spurious flips; ARP lattice simulations show quantized Chern phase attractors

- Submission ID: sub-2026-02-24-entropy-modulated-phase-lift-conductance-equatio
- Name: Entropy-Modulated Phase-Lift Conductance Equation (EM-PLC)
- Source: PR Root Guide framework (ARP/AIN/Phase-Lift/Adaptive-Pi)
- Units: TBD
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: Winding-aware, entropy-gated, suppression-coupled adaptive conductance law. Three structural couplings: (1) entropy-weighted reinforcement proportional to S(t), (2) phase-position selectivity via cos(theta_R/2pi_a) embedding branch geometry into conductance evolution, (3) quadratic winding-penalty stabilization suppressing runaway multi-sheet excursions. Coupled with adaptive bound dynamics d(pi_a)/dt = alpha_pi*S(t) - mu_pi*(pi_a - pi_0) + eta_pi*r_b and parity-mass coupling m_eff = m_0 + beta*<Delta_theta_R^2>/(2*pi_a)^2 - gamma*r_b.
- Equation: \frac{dG_{ij}}{dt} = \alpha_G\,S(t)\,|I_{ij}| \cos\!\Big(\frac{\theta_{R,ij}}{2\pi_a}\Big) - \mu_G G_{ij} - \lambda_G\,G_{ij}\,\frac{\Delta\theta_{R,ij}^2}{(2\pi_a)^2}
- Assumptions: ARP/AIN plasticity framework; Phase-Lift unwrapping for theta_{R,ij}; Global entropy S(t) gates adaptation; Companion adaptive bound equation d(pi_a)/dt couples via entropy and parity; Parity-mass coupling m_eff connects winding variance to topological gap; Stable fixed points at integer Chern sectors
- Evidence: Companion ruler equation: d(pi_a)/dt = alpha_pi*S - mu_pi*(pi_a - pi_0) + eta_pi*r_b; Parity-mass coupling: m_eff = m_0 + beta*<Delta_theta_R^2>/(2pi_a)^2 - gamma*r_b; Steady-state conductance: G* = alpha_G*S*|I|*cos(theta_R/(2pi_a)) / (mu_G + lambda_G*Delta_theta_R^2/(2pi_a)^2); Compatible with White Papers 01-05 (ARP, AIN, Adaptive-Pi, Phase-Lift, Redshift); EGATL_Autonomous_Chern_Locking_whitepaper_v0_1.pdf
