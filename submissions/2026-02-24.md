- Submission ID: sub-2026-02-24-mesh-synced-certificate-consistency
- Name: Mesh-Synced Certificate Consistency
- Source: manual setup
- Units: TBD
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: Chain-level consistency metric for equation certificates across synchronized nodes.
- Equation: \\Delta H_{cert}(t)=H_{nodeA}(t)-H_{nodeB}(t)\\to 0
- Assumptions: Nodes share deterministic genesis; Consensus endpoint converges under bounded delays
