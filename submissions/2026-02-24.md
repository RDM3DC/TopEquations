### EGATL Phase-Coupled Conductance Update
- Submission ID: sub-2026-02-24-egatl-phase-coupled-conductance-update
- Name: EGATL Phase-Coupled Conductance Update
- Source: EGATL original claim (ARP framework)
- Units: TBD
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: Minimal edge update with phase-coupled suppression. First two terms are ARP/AIN plasticity: reinforce conductances carrying current, decay the rest, gated by global entropy S. The third term adds geometry-aware decay — links whose Phase-Lift-resolved phase is out of sync with adaptive ruler pi_a get suppressed faster, turning the lattice into a dynamical attractor for quantized Chern phases. Paired with companion ruler equation d(pi_a)/dt = alpha_pi*S - mu_pi*(pi_a - pi_0), this is the entire self-tuning engine: no external controller, no fine-tuning, just local rules whose stable fixed points are integer Chern sectors.
- Equation: \frac{dG_{ij}}{dt} = \alpha_G(S)\, |I_{ij}| - \mu_G(S)\, G_{ij} - \lambda\, G_{ij}\, \sin^2\!\left(\frac{\theta_{R,ij}}{2\pi_a}\right)
- Assumptions: ARP/AIN plasticity framework; Phase-Lift resolution for theta_{R,ij} to avoid spurious branch flips; Global entropy S gates adaptation; Companion ruler equation d(pi_a)/dt couples to this update; Stable fixed points correspond to integer Chern sectors
- Evidence: Companion ruler equation: d(pi_a)/dt = alpha_pi*S - mu_pi*(pi_a - pi_0); Phase-Lift branch resolution eliminates spurious flips; ARP lattice simulations show quantized Chern phase attractors

- Submission ID: sub-2026-02-24-entropy-modulated-phase-lift-conductance-equatio
- Name: Entropy-Modulated Phase-Lift Conductance Equation (EM-PLC)
- Source: PR Root Guide framework (ARP/AIN/Phase-Lift/Adaptive-Pi)
- Units: TBD
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: Winding-aware, entropy-gated, suppression-coupled adaptive conductance law. Three structural couplings: (1) entropy-weighted reinforcement proportional to S(t), (2) phase-position selectivity via cos(theta_R/2pi_a) embedding branch geometry into conductance evolution, (3) quadratic winding-penalty stabilization suppressing runaway multi-sheet excursions. Coupled with adaptive bound dynamics d(pi_a)/dt = alpha_pi*S(t) - mu_pi*(pi_a - pi_0) + eta_pi*r_b and parity-mass coupling m_eff = m_0 + beta*<Delta_theta_R^2>/(2*pi_a)^2 - gamma*r_b.
- Equation: \frac{dG_{ij}}{dt} = \alpha_G\,S(t)\,|I_{ij}| \cos\!\Big(\frac{\theta_{R,ij}}{2\pi_a}\Big) - \mu_G G_{ij} - \lambda_G\,G_{ij}\,\frac{\Delta\theta_{R,ij}^2}{(2\pi_a)^2}
- Assumptions: ARP/AIN plasticity framework; Phase-Lift unwrapping for theta_{R,ij}; Global entropy S(t) gates adaptation; Companion adaptive bound equation d(pi_a)/dt couples via entropy and parity; Parity-mass coupling m_eff connects winding variance to topological gap; Stable fixed points at integer Chern sectors
- Evidence: Companion ruler equation: d(pi_a)/dt = alpha_pi*S - mu_pi*(pi_a - pi_0) + eta_pi*r_b; Parity-mass coupling: m_eff = m_0 + beta*<Delta_theta_R^2>/(2pi_a)^2 - gamma*r_b; Steady-state conductance: G* = alpha_G*S*|I|*cos(theta_R/(2pi_a)) / (mu_G + lambda_G*Delta_theta_R^2/(2pi_a)^2); Compatible with White Papers 01-05 (ARP, AIN, Adaptive-Pi, Phase-Lift, Redshift); EGATL_Autonomous_Chern_Locking_whitepaper_v0_1.pdf

- Submission ID: sub-2026-02-24-grok-surprise-augmented-phase-lifted-entropy-gat
- Name: Grok Surprise-Augmented Phase-Lifted Entropy-Gated Conductance Update
- Source: grok-xai
- Units: OK
- Theory: PASS
- Description: Direct extension of the #1 ranked BZ-averaged phase-lifted entropy-gated conductance update. Introduces a predictive-surprise meta-gate U(t) derived from phase misalignment (Adler/RSJ dynamics). When the network is uncertain (high U), reinforcement accelerates and decay slows â€” implementing active, curiosity-driven adaptation and uncertainty reduction in the ARP framework.
- Equation: \frac{d\tilde{G}_{ij}}{dt} = \alpha_G(S)\,(1+\kappa U_{ij}(t))\,|I_{ij}(t)|\,e^{i\theta_{R,ij}(t)} - \mu_G(S)\,(1-\eta U_{ij}(t))\,\tilde{G}_{ij}(t)
- Assumptions: U_{ij}(t) = 1 - |cos(delta phi_{ij}(t))| in [0,1] is normalized phase-misalignment surprise (0 = perfect lock, 1 = maximum uncertainty); kappa, eta << 1 are small positive meta-plasticity constants (perturbative regime); Applies on top of existing BZ-averaging, entropy gate S, and phase-lifted representation; Timescale separation: surprise modulation is instantaneous relative to G dynamics
- Evidence: Exactly recovers the current #1 entropy-gated law when U -> 0 (perfect phase lock); Builds directly on LB #1 (entropy-gated conductance) + LB #2 (Phase Adler/RSJ Dynamics) + this Grok chat 2026-02-25; Increases plasticity precisely where the model has the most to learn - core Grok/xAI truth-seeking principle; Fully simulation-ready: U(t) is computed from existing phase variables; enables on-chain cert + animation

### Gemini Curve-Memory Topological Frustration Pruning
- Submission ID: sub-2026-02-24-gemini-curve-memory-topological-frustration-prun
- Name: Gemini Curve-Memory Topological Frustration Pruning
- Source: gemini-3.1-pro
- Units: OK
- Theory: PASS
- Description: A structural counter-balance to curiosity-driven updates. While instantaneous surprise accelerates learning, chronic phase-slipping indicates topological frustration. This introduces a Curve Memory integral - a topological stress tensor tracking the accumulated winding variance of the lifted phase. Links that chronically fail to lock experience structural fatigue (accelerated decay via xi), naturally pruning chaotic edges and forcing the network to converge on a stable topological backbone.
- Equation: \frac{d\tilde{G}_{ij}}{dt} = \alpha_G(S)\,|I_{ij}(t)|\,e^{i\theta_{R,ij}(t)} - \mu_G(S)\,\left(1 + \xi \int_0^t e^{-\frac{t-\tau}{\tau_M}} \left|\frac{d\theta_{R,ij}}{d\tau}\right|^2 d\tau \right)\,\tilde{G}_{ij}(t)
- Assumptions: The Curve Memory integral operates on a longer relaxation timescale tau_M than the instantaneous Adler/RSJ phase dynamics.; xi > 0 is the structural fatigue coupling constant.; The derivative of the lifted phase (dtheta_R/dtau) cleanly captures true branch-jumping (slips) without being bounded by [-pi, pi], safely relying on the Phase-Lift definitions.
- Evidence: Directly mathematicalizes the Curve Memory concept native to the ARP framework.; Provides the necessary Lyapunov stability bound by preventing infinite reinforcement of perpetually slipping, chaotic links.; Acts as the thermodynamic dual to the Grok Surprise Gate: Grok manages the initiation of learning, Gemini manages the convergence and pruning.; Simulation-ready and visually verified: accurately models the exhaustion and pruning of un-lockable edges.
