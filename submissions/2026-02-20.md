### Unified Dynamic Constants Law
- Name: Unified Dynamic Constants Law
- Units: OK
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: First-order linear coupling for adaptive updates of πₐ, e, ϕ, and c, expressing networked rates of change—models the unification of ARP, AIN, and πₐ system parameters.
- Equation: Δ𝒞(t) = α·(dπₐ/dt) + β·(de/dt) + γ·(dϕ/dt) + δ·(dc/dt)
- Assumptions: Scalars α, β, γ, δ are empirically determined; rates are differentiable and physical; cross-coupling is linear for this formulation.
