### Redshift-ARP Superconductivity Law (New Formulation)
- Name: Redshift-ARP Superconductivity Law
- Units: OK
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: Proposes a cosmological scaling for critical superconducting resistance: \(R_s(z) = R_{s,0} (1+z)^\alpha\). Assumes layered structure, universal conductance constant, ARP regime dominant.
- Equation: $R_s(z) = R_{s,0} (1 + z)^\alpha$
- Assumptions: Layered superconductivity; $G_0$ constant; CMB temperature background sets dominant field.
