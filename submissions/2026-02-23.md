### Redshift-ARP Superconductivity Law
- Name: Redshift-ARP Superconductivity Law
- Units: WARN
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: Connects cosmological redshift with superconducting phase drops, positing an ARP-parameterized damping of the carrier phase. Expressed as:
- Equation: z_eff ≈ f(σ_ARP, T) · exp(-κ·L_super), where κ is an ARP-phase damping rate, σ_ARP adaptive conductance, L_super is superconducting length.
- Assumptions: κ depends weakly on temperature; uniform superconducting channel; redshift modeled as conductance loss in presence of ARP-like gradients.
- Animation: planned
