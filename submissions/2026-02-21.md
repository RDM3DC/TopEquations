### Curve Memory — Fine-Structure Emergence Principle
- Name: Curve Memory Fine-Structure Emergence
- Units: OK
- Theory: PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS
- Description: Formalizes the emergence of the fine-structure constant (≈1/137) via resonant harmonic conditions in curve memory, assuming an equilibrium state governed by ARP-influenced boundary dynamics.
- Equation: α ≈ 1/(2π·N_eff), N_eff = effective mode count at stable resonance, constrained by geometric and material ARP factors.
- Assumptions: N_eff is determined from a combination of curvature energy, geometry, and networked ARP-coupled memory modes. ARP boundary damping is linearized for tractability.
