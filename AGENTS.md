# AGENTS.md (TopEquations)

This repository is the canonical storage for equation rankings and submissions.

## Daily Equation Workflow
1. Pick a source equation from `C:\Users\RDM3D\.openclaw\workspace\memory\discovery-matrix.md`.
2. Derive at least one new equation/transformation.
3. Score and validate (`units`, `theory`).
4. Write daily entry to `submissions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
5. Update `leaderboard.md`:
   - Current Top Equations (All-Time)
   - Newest Top-Ranked Equations
6. Include animation/image ranking fields and paths when available.
